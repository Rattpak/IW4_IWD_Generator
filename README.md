# IW4_IWD_Generator

## Very Early Access
- This branch does not have the ability to generate the IWD file itself, but will still tell you exactly where each texture is within the IWD files
- There is literally no error checking on this right now, but that shouldn't be a problem if you simply follow the instructions

## How To Use
- Use Greyhound to find the model you want, MAKE SURE USE GLOBAL IMAGE FOLDER IS UNCHECKED IN SETTINGS, and click export
- Open this program and input or drag you MW2 Root folder on the program
- Drag the folder of the exported greyhound model onto the program
- It will tell you exactly where each texture is within the IWD files. For now, you can grab them manually
